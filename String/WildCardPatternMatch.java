//https://leetcode.com/problems/wildcard-matching/
//Taken from discussion - felt intuitive 
// greedy solution with idea of DFS
// starj stores the position of last * in p
// last_match stores the position of the previous matched char in s after a *
// e.g. 
// s: a c d s c d
// p: * c d
// after the first match of the *, starj = 0 and last_match = 1
// when we come to i = 3 and j = 3, we know that the previous match of * is actually wrong, 
// (the first branch of DFS we take is wrong)
// then it resets j = starj + 1 
// since we already know i = last_match will give us the wrong answer
// so this time i = last_match+1 and we try to find a longer match of *
// then after another match we have starj = 0 and last_match = 4, which is the right solution
// since we don't know where the right match for * ends, we need to take a guess (one branch in DFS), 
// and store the information(starj and last_match) so we can always backup to the last correct place and take another guess.
